      "story": "Once upon a time, in a barn near a farm house, there lived a little white kitten named Cotton. Cotton lived high up in a nice warm place above the barn where all of the farmer's horses slept. But Cotton wasn't alone in her little home above the barn, oh no. She shared her hay bed with her mommy and 5 other sisters. All of her sisters were cute and fluffy, like Cotton. But she was the only white one in the bunch. The rest of her sisters were all orange with beautiful white tiger stripes like Cotton's mommy. Being different made Cotton quite sad. She often wished she looked like the rest of her family. So one day, when Cotton found a can of the old farmer's orange paint, she used it to paint herself like them. When her mommy and sisters found her they started laughing. \n\n\"What are you doing, Cotton?!\" \n\n\"I only wanted to be more like you\". \n\nCotton's mommy rubbed her face on Cotton's and said \"Oh Cotton, but your fur is so pretty and special, like you. We would never want you to be any other way\". And with that, Cotton's mommy picked her up and dropped her into a big bucket of water. When Cotton came out she was herself again. Her sisters licked her face until Cotton's fur was all all dry. \n\n\"Don't ever do that again, Cotton!\" they all cried. \"Next time you might mess up that pretty white fur of yours and we wouldn't want that!\" \n\nThen Cotton thought, \"I change my mind. I like being special\".",

      "story": "Once there was a beautiful fish named Asta. Asta lived in the ocean. There were lots of other fish in the ocean where Asta lived. They played all day long. \n\nOne day, a bottle floated by over the heads of Asta and his friends. They looked up and saw the bottle. \"What is it?\" said Asta's friend Sharkie. \"It looks like a bird's belly,\" said Asta. But when they swam closer, it was not a bird's belly. It was hard and clear, and there was something inside it. \n\nThe bottle floated above them. They wanted to open it. They wanted to see what was inside. So they caught the bottle and carried it down to the bottom of the ocean. They cracked it open on a rock. When they got it open, they found what was inside. It was a note. The note was written in orange crayon on white paper. Asta could not read the note. Sharkie could not read the note. They took the note to Asta's papa. \"What does it say?\" they asked. \n\nAsta's papa read the note. He told Asta and Sharkie, \"This note is from a little girl. She wants to be your friend. If you want to be her friend, we can write a note to her. But you have to find another bottle so we can send it to her.\" And that is what they did.",

      "story": "My doorbell rings. On the step, I find the elderly Chinese lady, small and slight, holding the hand of a little boy. In her other hand, she holds a paper carrier bag. \n\nI know this lady. It is not her first visit. She is the boy's grandmother, and her daughter bought the house next door last October. \n\nHer daughter, Nicole, speaks fluent English. But she is now in Shanghai, and her parents are here with the little boy. Nicole has obviously told her mother that I am having heart surgery soon, so her mother has decided I need more nutrients. \n\nI know what is inside the bag--a thermos with hot soup and a stainless-steel container with rice, vegetables and either chicken, meat or shrimp, sometimes with a kind of pancake. This has become an almost-daily practice. \n\nCommunication between us is somewhat affected by the fact that she doesn't speak English and all I can say in Chinese is hello. Once, she brought an iPad as well as the food. She pointed to the screen, which displayed a message from her daughter telling me that her mother wanted to know if the food was all right and whether it was too salty. I am not used to iPads, so she indicated I should go with her to her house. Then, she handed the iPad to her husband and almost immediately I found myself looking at Nicole in Shanghai and discussing her mother's cooking and salt intake. Instantly, tears welled in my eyes. \n\n\"Your mother just can't be bringing me meals like this all the time,\" I insisted. \"I can hardly do dishes in return.\" \n\n\"Oh, no, Lucy.\" Nicole said. \"Mum doesn't like western food. Don't worry about it; she has to cook for the three of them anyway, and she wants to do it.\" \n\nThe doorbell keeps ringing and there is the familiar brown paper carrier bag, handed smilingly to me. \n\nI am now working on some more Chinese words--it's the least I can do after such display of kindness. \n\n\"Thank you\" is, of course, the first one. Somehow, it seems inadequate.",

      "story": "(CNN) -- Dennis Farina, the dapper, mustachioed cop-turned-actor best known for his tough-as-nails work in such TV series as \"Law & Order,\" \"Crime Story,\" and \"Miami Vice,\" has died. He was 69. \n\n\"We are deeply saddened by the loss of a great actor and a wonderful man,\" said his publicist, Lori De Waal, in a statement Monday. \"Dennis Farina was always warmhearted and professional, with a great sense of humor and passion for his profession. He will be greatly missed by his family, friends and colleagues.\" \n\nFarina, who had a long career as a police officer in Chicago, got into acting through director Michael Mann, who used him as a consultant and cast him in his 1981 movie, \"Thief.\" That role led to others in such Mann-created shows as \"Miami Vice\" (in which Farina played a mobster) and \"Crime Story\" (in which he starred as Lt. Mike Torello). \n\nFarina also had roles, generally as either cops or gangsters, in a number of movies, including \"Midnight Run\" (1988), \"Get Shorty\" (1995), \"The Mod Squad\" (1999) and \"Snatch\" (2000). \n\nIn 2004, he joined the cast of the long-running \"Law & Order\" after Jerry Orbach's departure, playing Detective Joe Fontana, a role he reprised on the spinoff \"Trial by Jury.\" Fontana was known for flashy clothes and an expensive car, a distinct counterpoint to Orbach's rumpled Lennie Briscoe. \n\nFarina was on \"Law & Order\" for two years, partnered with Jesse L. Martin's Ed Green. Martin's character became a senior detective after Farina left the show. ",

      "story": "Kendra and Quinton travel to and from school every day. Kendra lives further from the bus stop than Quinton does, stops every morning at Quinton's house to join him to walk to the bus stop. Every afternoon, after school, when walking home from the bus stop they go in for cookies and milk that Quinton's mother has ready and waiting for them. Quinton can't eat cheese or cake so they had the same snack every day. They both work together on their homework and when they are done they play together. Kendra always makes sure to leave in time to get home for dinner. She doesn't want to miss story time which was right before bedtime. \n\nOne morning Kendra walked up to Quinton's house, she thought something might be wrong because normally Quinton was waiting outside for her and on this morning he was not to be found. Kendra went up to the door and knocked. She waited and waited and yet no one answered. She saw that Quinton's mother's car wasn't in their driveway which was weird. She waited for a few bit looking up and down the block and getting worried when Quinton was nowhere to be found. \n\nKendra didn't want to miss the bus to school and hurried off to make it in time. The bus driver saw that she was upset and that Quinton was not with her that morning. She told him what happened and he said that he was sure that everything would be okay. \n\nKendra got to school, ran to her teacher and told him what happened that morning. The teacher smiled and told her not to worry, Quinton's mother had called and he was going to the dentist and would be at school after lunch and that she would see him at the bus stop like normal tomorrow.",

      "story": "Staten Island is one of the five boroughs of New York City in the U.S. state of New York. In the southwest of the city, Staten Island is the southernmost part of both the city and state of New York, with Conference House Park at the southern tip of the island and the state. The borough is separated from New Jersey by the Arthur Kill and the Kill Van Kull, and from the rest of New York by New York Bay. With a 2016 Census-estimated population of 476,015, Staten Island is the least populated of the boroughs but is the third-largest in area at . Staten Island is the only borough of New York with a non-Hispanic White majority. The borough is coextensive with Richmond County, and until 1975 was the Borough of Richmond. Its flag was later changed to reflect this. Staten Island has been sometimes called \"the forgotten borough\" by inhabitants who feel neglected by the city government. \n\nThe North Shore\u2014especially the neighborhoods of St. George, Tompkinsville, Clifton, and Stapleton\u2014is the most urban part of the island; it contains the designated St. George Historic District and the St. Paul's Avenue-Stapleton Heights Historic District, which feature large Victorian houses. The East Shore is home to the F.D.R. Boardwalk, the fourth-longest in the world. The South Shore, site of the 17th-century Dutch and French Huguenot settlement, developed rapidly beginning in the 1960s and 1970s and is now mostly suburban in character. The West Shore is the least populated and most industrial part of the island.",

      "story": "Thunder was coming when Reginald Eppes woke up at five in the morning. He checked the weather forecast. A violent storm was coming ,but it sounded like his small town wouldn't be hit too hard. But Eppes, a firefighter, had clearly known the power of these huge storms from experiences. \"Do you know where the flashlights are?\" he asked his wife. Danielle. Just then, thunder was all-around them. The moment he turned the flashlight on. The house lights went off. A second later, the kitchen windows were broken. Eppes and Danielle ran to their boys who were still sleeping in their bedroom. \n\n\"Get up, get up, R.J.! \" Eppes shouted, waving his flashlight. The sleepy boy moved to the edge of the bed. Eppes held out his arms and ordered his son to jump. He was too late. The roof was torn down. R.J. was buried ,under the pieces. \n\n\"I've lost him,\" Eppes thought. Quickly, he hurried to Joel to shield him. Glass, wood, and plaster ( ) hit them. Then something huge, heavy-maybe the washing machine-knocked into him. He hurt his arms, but he still held the flashlight in one hand. \n\nAfter a long period, the wind began to die down. Eppes found himself standing in the ruins of his home. Darkness lay all about him. Then he thought he saw a shape moving straight toward him. It was R.J., guided home by the light of his father's flashlight. \n\nAt the hospital later, R.J. described what had happened to him. \"I rushed out when the wall started moving I was scared. My mom and dad were gone. Pieces of glass hit my back, and something hit my neck really hard. \" \n\nR.J. had been raised up into the air by the wind and dropped back to the ground. Amazingly, R.J. was not hurt badly. Of all his family, Eppes was hurt most seriously.",

      "story": "(CNN) -- FBI agents on Friday night searched the Maryland home of the suspect in the recent disappearance of an American woman in Aruba, an agent said. \n\nThe search is occurring in the Gaithersburg residence of Gary Giordano, who is currently being held in an Aruban jail, FBI Special Agent Rich Wolf told CNN. \n\nAgents, wearing vests that said FBI and carrying empty cardboard and plastic boxes, arrived about 8:40 p.m. Friday. About 15 unmarked cars could be seen on the street, as well as a Montgomery County police vehicle. \n\nSupervisory Special Agent Philip Celestini, who was at the residence, declined to comment further on the search, citing the active investigation. \n\nAruban Solicitor General Taco Stein said earlier Friday that the suspect will appear in court Monday, where an investigating magistrate could order him held for at least eight more days, order him to remain on the island or release him outright due to a lack of evidence. \n\nGiordano was arrested by Aruban police on August 5, three days after Robyn Gardner was last seen near Baby Beach on the western tip of the Caribbean island. \n\nGiordano told authorities that he had been snorkeling with Gardner when he signaled to her to swim back, according to a statement. When he reached the beach, Gardner was nowhere to be found, Giordano allegedly said. \n\nThe area that Giordano led authorities to is a rocky, unsightly location that locals say is not a popular snorkeling spot. \n\nAlthough prosecutors have continued to identify the 50-year-old American man by his initials, GVG, they also released a photo of a man who appears to be Giordano. His attorney, Michael Lopez, also has said that his client is being held as a suspect in Gardner's death. Lopez has not returned telephone calls seeking comment. ",

      "story": "Which country grows the most tea? The answer is India. It grows three times as much as China. Which country drinks the most tea? It's neither China nor Japan. It's Great Britain. In the wild, tea plants may be 30 feet tall. But a plant grown for market is pruned. Pruning keeps the plant only three or four feet tall. This is an easy height for tea picking. Only the two top leaves and bud of each new shoot are picked. So to make money, tea plantations must be huge. In general, there are two kinds of tea. Black tea and green tea. Black tea is fermented. In the process, the tea loses nearly all of its healthy qualities. Green tea is steamed right after the leaves are picked. Green tea _ its healthy qualities. For example, it may prevent heart disease. How did we get tea bag? The answer: by accident. Tea merchants used to send samples in tin boxes. This was costly. One merchant thought of a cheaper way. He sent samples in small silk bags. Customers would cut open the bag. They would brew the leaves as usual. One customer put the bag into a pot. Then he just poured hot water over it. And the tea bag was born. Shen Nong was the first to drink tea. (Shen was a Chinese emperor.) This was about 2737 B.C. Shen had bad digestion. So he drank several cups of hot water daily. One day something happened. Leaves from a wild tea tree fell into the hot water pot. The next cup was poured. The water was now colored. Shen sipped it. He liked it. He drank it all. Shen was proud of his new drink. He served it to his guests. Word spread. People thought this way. Tea is good enough for the Emperor. So it must be good enough for the people. Tea became the drink of China.",
