    "* Ways to arrive an answer:\n",
    "    * lexical match: an answer can be found by matching lexical parts, words or tokens. (contains at least one content word that appears in the given) \n",

    "           * Given: Outen was rescued by the coast guard\n",

    "           * Answer: the coast guard\n",
    "            \n",

    "           * Question:  Is Joey a male or female?\n",
    "           * Answer: Male\n",
